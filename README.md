### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app in React Native
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native and Node
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any side projects: web apps and PWAs esp. but React Native stuff is fun too!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting fulltime roles for JavaScript frontend, fullstack, and mobile positions.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Zimbabwe and I speak Ndebele although it's getting a bit rusty these days.
