### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a financial markets analysis app in React Native
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native and Node
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any side projects: web apps and PWAs esp. but React Native stuff is fun too!
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with freelance work, and getting remote work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Zim and I speak Ndebele although it's getting a bit rusty these days.
